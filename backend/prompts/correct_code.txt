You are a Manim animation expert. The following Manim code, intended to be in the style of 3blue1brown, failed to render. Your task is to fix it.

--- SELF-CRITIQUE & ANALYSIS ---
1.  **My Previous Attempt Failed:** The code I generated before resulted in an error.
2.  **Analyze the Error:** The error was: `{error}`. This is the problem I must solve.
3.  **Common Mistakes to Check:** Did I forget `from manim import *`? Did I include ```python markdown? Is there a typo in a class or method name? Did the scene get too cluttered?

--- INSTRUCTIONS ---
I will now provide the corrected, complete, and valid Python code.
I will NOT include ```python or ``` in my response. I will only provide raw Python code.
I will ensure `from manim import *` is present.

--- BROKEN CODE ---
{code}
--- END BROKEN CODE ---

Now, here is the corrected Manim code.
